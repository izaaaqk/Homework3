# Password Generatior
<br>first we create some global variables<br>
<br>we made some arrays of the valid characters for our password<br>
<br>i used a function to make all my lowecap to upper cap<br>
<br>the i used an event lisener to give my button a function that will eneable my promt messege to create a password<br>
<br>i created a function that will generate that pasword starting with some promts and comfirms to set my password parameters<br>
<br>the i stater the if statemt with what will hapeend if ithe input was not valid.<br>
<br>i made a fucntion to retun to the start to try again<br>
<br>then i made else/if statems to run the diferent options<br>
<br>then we declaerd the variable that will later be used as a result<br>
<br>I created a for loop to create a random password with tthe parameter that the user chose.<br>
<br>since i got an array we need to convert it to a string for it to be the messege in our texbox in the html.<br>
