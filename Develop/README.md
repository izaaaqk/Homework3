# Homework3
fist we create some global variables
we made some arrays of the valid characters for our password
i used a function to make all my lowecap to upper cap
the i used an event lisener to give my button a function that will eneable my promt messege to create a password
i created a function that will generate that pasword starting with some promts and comfirms to set my password parameters
the i stater the if statemt with what will hapeend if ithe input was not valid.
i made a fucntion to retun to the start to try again
then i made else/if statems to run the diferent options
then we declaerd the variable that will later be used as a result
i created a for loop to create a random password with tthe parameter that the user chose.
since i got an array we need to convert it to a string for it to be the messege in our texbox in the html.
